# Performing-Packet-Capture-and-Traffic-Analysis

## Objective
Upon successful completion of this lab, participants will acquire the essential skills needed to navigate and analyze network traffic using Wireshark. The overarching learning objectives encompass the ability to capture live network data, analyze the captured traffic, discern crucial information corresponding to each layer within the TCP/IP protocol stack, apply filters to selectively isolate specific types of network traffic, and differentiate between the protocol stacks of wired and wireless network data. Adhering to the provided guidelines in scholarly writing is imperative in the pursuit of effective knowledge transfer. Employing a clear, direct, and simple language ensures that learners comprehend these objectives without ambiguity or unnecessary complexity. The avoidance of biased language and colloquialisms fosters an inclusive learning environment, while steering clear of rhetorical questions and contractions maintains a formal and scholarly tone. This approach aligns with the academic standards of clarity and precision, facilitating a more effective transfer of knowledge to the participants engaging in this educational endeavor.
